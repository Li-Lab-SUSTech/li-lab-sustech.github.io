By training, I am a Particle Physicist that fell in love with Biological Physics shortly after graduating. I did my PhD in both the <a href="http://mhlangalab.org/">Musa Mhlanga</a> and <a href="https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/imaging-and-modeling/">Christophe Zimmer</a> laboratories, carrying out research between <a href="https://imm.medicina.ulisboa.pt/">IMM</a> (Portugal), <a href="https://www.pasteur.fr/en">Institut Pasteur</a> (France), <a href="https://www.csir.co.za/">CSIR</a> (South Africa) and <a href="https://andor.oxinst.com/">Andor Technology</a> (UK and USA). During this time, I entered the field of Super-Resolution Microscopy, developing technologies that enable imaging of cellular and viral structures at unprecedented resolution. During my PhD and postdoc, I applied the methods I developed to study Cell Signalling, T-cell Immunology and Viral Infection. In 2013 I established my first research group at UCL, with a dual emphasis on Developing new Imaging Technologies and Cell Biology research. In 2017 I was further invited to extend my group into the Francis Crick Institute, where I established a second small laboratory. In 2019 I was promoted to full Professor at UCL. My technological developments are widely disseminated to the Cell Biology and Biomedical research community. My algorithms QuickPALM, NanoJ, SRRF and SQUIRREL are among the most used and cited analytical methods in the Super-Resolution Microscopy field. My core philosophy has been to make my research reproducible, transparent and open-source.

<br><br><b>Talks biosketch:</b>
Prof. Ricardo Henriques is a group leader at Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, moving his laboratory in 2020 from University College London and Francis Crick Institute in the UK. His group uses optical and computational biophysics to study cell biology and host-pathogen interactions. He graduated in Physics, specialising in biophotonics and robotics. He finished his PhD in 2011, where he developed super-resolution microscopy technologies at the Musa Mhlanga lab. He then pursued postdoc research at Institut Pasteur Paris, studying HIV-1 T-cell infection through nanoscale imaging in the Christophe Zimmer lab.

<br><br><b>Career biosketch:</b>
Prof. Henriques became PhD in 2011 (Mhlanga lab – IMM and Zimmer lab – I. Pasteur), Ass. Prof. at UCL in 2013, PI at UCL-Crick in 2017, Chair at UCL in 2019, Co-Dir. of the Wellcome Trust Optical Biology PhD Progr. in 2019, PI at IGC and Hon. Prof. at UCL in 2020. He is a fellow of the RMS, bioRxiv affiliate, member of the outreach In2ScienceUK, and ScienceForUkraine. His group uses optical and computational biophysics to study cell biology and host-pathogen interactions.
