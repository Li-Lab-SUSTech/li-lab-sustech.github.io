<p> <b>Overview:</b>
Afonso is interested in studying the assembly and functionality of supramolecular complexes between host and pathogen factors. His approach involves the development and application of super-resolution microscopy guided by machine-learning algorithms to describe these structures at the nanometer scale.

Afonso joined our laboratory in February 2021 as an IGC IBB PhD Student.
